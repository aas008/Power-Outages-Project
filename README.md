## Introduction

What happens when the lights go out for over 50,000 people at once? Between January 2000 and July 2016, the United States experienced numerous major power outages that significantly impacted communities across the country. This analysis delves into a comprehensive dataset from the Department of Energy that tracks these major disruptions, defined as outages affecting at least 50,000 customers or causing an unplanned loss of at least 300 megawatts of energy.

Our investigation centers around a critical question: **How do climate patterns and regional characteristics influence the severity of power outages, and can we predict their duration to improve emergency response planning?** Understanding these patterns is crucial for utility companies, emergency responders, and policymakers to better prepare for and mitigate the impact of future outages.

The dataset, sourced from Purdue University's Laboratory for Advancing Sustainable Critical Infrastructure, contains 1,534 major outage events. For each event, we analyze several key variables:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `'YEAR'` | Year an outage occurred |
| `'MONTH'` | Month an outage occurred |
| `'U.S._STATE'` | State the outage occurred in |
| `'NERC.REGION'` | North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) regions involved in the outage event |
| `'CLIMATE.REGION'` | U.S. Climate regions as specified by National Centers for Environmental Information (9 Regions) |
| `'ANOMALY.LEVEL'`| Oceanic El Niño/La Niña (ONI) index referring to the cold and warm episodes by season |
| `'CAUSE.CATEGORY'` | Categories of all the events causing the major power outages |
| `'OUTAGE.DURATION'` | Duration of outage events (in minutes) |
| `'DEMAND.LOSS.MW'` | Amount of peak demand lost during an outage event (in Megawatt) [but in many cases, total demand is reported] |
| `'CUSTOMERS.AFFECTED'` | Number of customers affected by the power outage event |
| `'TOTAL.PRICE'` | Average monthly electricity price in the U.S. state (cents/kilowatt-hour) |
| `'TOTAL.SALES'` | Total electricity consumption in the U.S. state (megawatt-hour) |
| `'TOTAL.CUSTOMERS'` | Annual number of total customers served in the U.S. state |

Through our analysis, we aim to build a predictive model that can estimate the duration of power outages based on initial conditions and regional characteristics. By analyzing factors such as climate patterns, geographic location, and regional infrastructure, we will attempt to predict how long an outage might last when it first occurs. This prediction capability could be invaluable for:

- Emergency Response Teams: Better resource allocation and response planning
- Utility Companies: More accurate customer communication and restoration timelines
- Local Governments: Improved disaster preparedness and mitigation strategies

Whether you're a utility company planning infrastructure improvements, an emergency response team preparing for future events, or a concerned citizen wanting to understand power grid vulnerabilities, this analysis provides valuable insights into the patterns and predictability of major power disruptions.

## Assessment of Missingness

Here's what a Markdown table looks like. Note that the code for this table was generated _automatically_ from a DataFrame, using

```py
print(counts[['Quarter', 'Count']].head().to_markdown(index=False))
```

| Quarter     |   Count |
|:------------|--------:|
| Fall 2020   |       3 |
| Winter 2021 |       2 |
| Spring 2021 |       6 |
| Summer 2021 |       4 |
| Fall 2021   |      55 |
